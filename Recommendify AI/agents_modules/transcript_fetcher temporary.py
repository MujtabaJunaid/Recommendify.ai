                'transcript': "why do some people say that these are some of the best headphones in their price category or even above perhaps because the build quality is of Premium variety and the amount of movement in the hinge is really impressive they're really sturdy but flexible at the same time this my friends is my new toy from a company called Sony had them for a while and they're shaped like this on purpose because when they expand they give you the right amount of tension so they can sit on your head really comfortably on the one end we have a mini audio jack and a type-c USB port on the on the app you can toggle this button here to connect them to two devices at the same time which is really impressive the whole thing comes with this wonderful case here where if you open it up you can put the headphones here and the audio jack as well as the USB is hosted in this magnetically held thing these are really comfortable and for those of you who watched until the end if you have a Sony TV you can plug it into your Sony TV and get a separate dial for the volume these are called Sony wh1000 xm5 but we're just going to call them xm5"},

                'transcript': "the Sony alt wear is a new line of Sony headphones that doesn't replace their Flagship tier Sony wh1000 xm5 headphones but sits one tier below it and comes with a ton of options for a ton of base if you want it and still has a lot of great features that you expect from a Sony headphone like ANC but without those awful naming conventions Sony altar is way easier than Sony WF wait wh1000 xm5 so good job Sunny good job yay in this review you'll hear some objective test of the mics samples of how the alt feature works and how it changes the sound and so comparisons with the Sony wh1000 xm5 so you should be able to find out which one is the best choice for you this is my review of the Sony alt wear the design of the alware continues a similar design aesthetic that we have seen on the Sony wh1000 xm5 we have that earcuff design and that clean look when putting them side by side you can see how they got to the $200 price point compared to the XM 5's $400 list price point it's less premium than the xm5 overall the fit and finish are the clear differences instead of the pleasing soft touch finish found in the xm5 it has a met finish plastic and the petting along the headband isn't all wrapped in vegan leather but well more rigid plastic cooking the buttons feels less confident and more like Hollow plastic did I mention plastic for all I know adding a soft touch coating to this plastic would result in the same feeling as the xm5 but the ult wear does feel much cheaper with all that plastic but it's not all downgrades one thing that it brings back that many were bumped about on the xm5 is its ability to fold up which makes it great for traveling but that increases its risk of breaking there are pros and cons but it does come with a rigid case to help protect against that and it continues to provide an option to use them wired the ear cups on the alware are comfortable like the xm5 and barely have a touch more depth so if you had discomfort from your ears pushing up against the driver on the xm5 you likely will have the same issue here you also have autoplay pause sensors for when you put them on or remove them you have a mix of touch surface and button interactions on the alt wear on the right ear cup you can swipe to adjust the volume or change the track double tap to play and pause or hold your hand over the air cup to go into a transparency aware mode where it Ducks the volume level down you can have a conversation with someone and once you remove your hand from it it raises your volume back up and goes to ANC the left ear cup has your power impairing button ANC transparency toggle and the alt button which we'll discuss later battery life is 30 hours withc on and 50 hours withc off a 10-minute charge gives you 5 hours of playback so you can quickly get enough for most flights at a short charge ANC or active noise cancellation is one of the highlights of Sony's procs they're among the industry leaders in this area along with Bose and apple the alware continues that Legacy using the V1 chip processor used in the xm4 lineup there's also a wind noise reduction mic or sensor right here that is supposed to help instead of telling you what I think how about some objective samples okay we have the binaural microphone to do the andc comparison test so you want to make sure that you have headphones ear buds in and both ears we have the with a quiet we have the wh1000 xm5 Inc mode in a quiet room how does this sound do you hear anything and now we have the transparency test on the alt wear how does it sound right here in a clean quiet room and now we have the wh1000 xm5 in transparency mode how does this sound in comparison to the alt wear in a quiet room this is what now we're in transparency mode now we have a fan test that's directed directly at the left ear this is ANC test with the wind or the fan blowing directly at the left ear cup do you hear any sort of distortions or anything like that now we have the1 xm5 Inc with test this is what the transparency mode sounds like on the old Weare with a fan directed directly at the left ear cup are you hearing any sort of noises I I hear some uh in my monitoring over here uh the little rustling here but we have this little thing right here on the side that is supposed to help with anti Windows there's a lot now you can definitely tell that the anti wind sensor on the alt wear is doing a lot uh I'm hearing a lot of noise on the 1x5 pry crazy while transparency is solid it's less transparent and natural than what you'd find on Apple or Bose's products that mid-range boost makes it sound more artificial but it's still good all right here are some objective mic tests for you to listen to you'll see which device I'm using in this situation labeled on the screen the prior one was the ult wear in this case it's the xm5 in a clean quiet room does that make sense hey I don't have a sponsor for the city however if you want to help

it would sound like if you were to receive an HD phone call while wearing the Sony wh1000 xm5 one thing to note for some reason on the color end I can kind of hear my own voice being repeated back to me so that's a bit interesting what are your observations and thoughts about thec transparency and mics let me know in the comments the alt Weare has a specially designed 40 mm driver which can push some serious low end without breaking up and becoming a mess it's honestly outrageous that's where the all button comes into play this is something new and present amongst Sony's entire alt line which also includes Bluetooth speakers and allows you to toggle between three settings off alt one and ALT two alt has a bit of a sound that is a bit brighter than what you typically associate with Sony headphones but also retains much of that base it's scooped in many ways all one reminds me of what Sony used to sound like in Prior generations of the 1000 XM series with a ton of bass added to it in a darker high-end their Sony wh 1000 xm5 has moved away from that in a step towards a more mature balanced and tasteful sound than before some people like that and some will miss that old dark super Bassy sound alt one provides a bit of that alt two is it reminds of when I was in high school and I saw those Honda Civics with a coffee can exhaust on it and a massive subwoofer inside the trunk imagine you're inside the trunk this is like the beets if you added beets to the beets a lot is going on it um it feels like a a subwoofer is in in my nose here's a sample to give you an idea of how the different settings change things hey hey Mar you know you doing something to me what I trying to do what try to doy [Music] baby [Music] [Applause] you see what I mean that's a that's a lot of base and how it's tuned primarily caters to a minimal set of genres like hip-hop and electronic music when I listen to something like metal or something that needs a tighter or cleaner sound the low and loose is control and it sounds like a of Rumble rather than a nice tight slap from a Kick Drum and all that rumbling seems a bit limiting to me so is the Sony alt Weare for you and what are my thoughts if you've been around this channel long enough or decent reading body language you can probably tell that the Sony alware is not for me it's not my taste and not something that I would personally use but my job as a Reviewer is to be empathetic think of who this is for and find the factors that would make this for or not for you despite my preferences so here are some things to consider if you're more of an audio file or audio mixing engineer like me who likes a more balanced sound the alt wear is not for you if you love having tons of bass and want to feel it pumping Larger than Life and to become one with the Deep base then the alt wear is for you have you like the older Sony Sound that is darker and basier than their recent releases the old wear may be a good fit if you like listening to various musical styles including ones with a tighter more percussive sound like metal Funk or gospel the old wear is not a good fit for you if you honestly couldn't tell or care about the difference and sound quality between an audio file headphone or a pair of headphones given to you on an airplane and want an affordable pair of headphones with greatz decent transparency and mics at a solid price then the alt wear is a good choice while the Sony alt Weare is not for me I'm glad this option is available for people who are not like me maybe that's you if it is you can find

                'transcript': "[Music] hey what's up mbhd here okay so for the past few years Sony's Flagship noise cancelling headphones have been the King of the Hill of course they've made some minor adjustments and feature additions over the past few so by the time they got to The Mark iiiii with their comfort and noise cancelling and USB type-c they were the top of the market and then the markv added Multi-Device support but they've essentially looked the same sounded excellent and they've been an easy recommendation as a result but these new Mark 5 on the other hand are a real departure from that formula a lot of the changes I do really like but there is one big one that I definitely don't so the first thing you might be wondering is is there actually a sound Improvement but I actually want to just start with the new design cuz you can see that they have this new shape that is this pretty minimal sharp and clean look there is still a dark and a light this light is a sort of a cream colored version and there's a lot of good things about this design the ear cups are slightly bigger and wider the new vegan leather material is so much softer it is it's kind of amazing it combines that with the super lightweight of the whole headphones to make this entire pair more comfortable to wear for long periods of time honestly I'm just going to say this is the most comfortable pair of noise cancelling headphones I've ever tried you still have a touch sensitive panel on the right side ear cup for skipping pausing Etc they actually still have onoff head detection despite not having a plastic cutout in the ear cup like the last one and there's now twice as many many slots for microphones around the outside it goes from four total to four on each side eight total microphones and I'll get into what that does for noise cancellation and voice quality in a second but you can see they're fairly minimal and hidden well in this new design but overall overall I actually still feel like this design is a downgrade for one main reason so what do you get noise cancelling headphones for right travel you're getting them to travel and so these old versions were the King of the Hill because they were obviously super comfortable had great noise cancellation and lots of features and good sound quality but they also folded up like this and fit into uh their little case just like that toss that in a bag and you're good to go this new version with this new design does not fold at all so with this new sliding headband design which is kind of like the Bose 700's and the airpods Max and so many others that's the only way of adjusting the size of the headphones so they no longer fold down into a smaller size and so as a result the case you carry them around in is quite a bit bigger uh it's kind of a cool case it looks like a modern backpack without the straps and it's got some angular origami type seams and folds along the sides and once you get inside there's a magnetic door over a compartment that holds your charging cable and an audio cable if you need one this is a great case it's basically exactly like the Bose 700's but yeah now it's just huge with bow though we saw them do this new design with the 700s but they at least kept around the quiet Comfort Series so the QC 45s still fold down like they always did and the airpods Mac are notoriously annoying to travel with even though I still try to make it work but these are wh1000 Mark 5 which on paper makes it the sequel to The markv so that's a little bit dangerous but I do know that they're keeping around the marvs these new Mark 5ivs are going to retail for $400 and they're going to keep around the marvs for $ 350 although you can already find them for like $ 329 or300 so these are starting to look kind of like a deal but let's just get past that design flaw they're still premium lightweight comfortable noise cancelling headphones and they have yet again bumped up the noise cancellation capabilities pretty significantly so I've been saying for years they're the King of the Hill for travel because as far as white noise is concerned like airplane engine road noise all that sort of stuff they do an A+ job at canceling that right when I put these on I immediately noticed it's even stronger it still crushes that droning low end but now some of the more higher frequencies are better canel out too appliances Wier stuff human voices too so yeah the last Sony's did have worldclass noise cancellation but these get even better and we can thank the extra microphones and processor for that now with any noise cancelling headphones and all those mics you also have a transparent mode these have it again and they have 20 levels of adjustment in the app of how much transparency gets through they're really good they are definitely better than the bows but the airpods max are still on a completely different level as far as transparency mode those are the best I've ever heard in any headphones it sounds like you're not wearing headphones you just hear everyone's voices and everything perfectly clearly and these just don't get that good like these just sound like a somewhat muffled version of reality uh especially with voices and the higher frequency stuff even though there is actually a specific enhanced voices toggle it just doesn't quite reach the airpods level as far as hearing your own voice but then for actual musical sound quality they are very similar to last year which is to say excellent and they do have a new 30mm carbon fiber driver and there is still ldac support if you have the right combination of smartphone and music Source but I think I can safely say if I have an Android phone the these to me are among the absolute best sounding noise cancelling wireless headphones available again they don't sound as good they're not as full and crisp and balanced as airpods Max paired with an iPhone but obviously that's just for iPhone users that have $550 to burn but yeah there's just something about really good noise cancelling headphones that feels like magic like I can be in a crowded area where my eyes tell me this is a loud area but to hear absolutely silence behind a perfectly isolated Baseline and he every detail of a vocal of some song like I'm in a live recording session is so sick that's what makes these headphones so good there were some rumors about the battery life getting bumped from 30 to 40 hours which would have been crazy but that's not what happened they are rated for the same 30 hours of battery life as the mark 4S and from my experience so far they've right about matched it uh so 40 like would have been nice and amazing but I still think 30 and the use I've gotten out of these is still very good the one improvement though uh is the charging faster charging so you can plug these in for 3 minutes and get 3 hours of listening out of it so if you just need to plug in real quick before you go head off to some trip somewhere that's very convenient again it's a travel feature but that's what that's what I want to break this all back down to at the end of the day these are travel headphones and they no longer fold which means they are everything about them is bigger and and more difficult to travel with than the last ones oh and also this this might be minor but I do have to mention it so if you're wearing the mark 4S like this and you didn't want to like do the hold to speak or listen to people and you just want to take them off real quick you can do that and then fold them down so they're just facing down and you can do other stuff and they'll just sit here the Mark fivs if you wear them correctly which is right side left side they don't fold down flat they actually only fold up and that's I'm definitely nitpicking like that's a small small thing but for $400 that's another thing that's not in the new headphones that was nicer about the old ones so if you're actually thinking about getting these headphones this is here this is a pretty nuanced recommendation but if you are using an Android phone and your bag is big enough and you plan on using these for travel listening to music phone calls if you're working with these all that sort of thing these are going to be amazing you get the Sony app you've got all the customization in the world you want to do ldac listening even they sound like very good headphones and they work really well so comfortable love these headphones but if you're really anyone else I'm going to bring back the marvs again for this I really think you should consider the marvs of course right because number one they're going to cost much less they number two actually fold down so if you want them to take up less space in your bag but they're also like 90% of these headphones they sound just about as good um they might not be as trendy or or premium looking as the new design but like you're going to get the same Comfort the same battery life really the only thing you're missing out on is the slightly faster charging and what those extra mics and processor get you for noise cancellation oh wait there's extra mics so maybe voice quality too all right so this is an audio test of the Sony wh1000 XM 4S still a bad name uh Sony uh water bottles available at mbc.com just so you know also there's some voices in the background there's some various noises but this is it it's okay it's okay for a mic and so now this is the audio quality for the w1000x m5s I think it sounds better it definitely isolates The Voice a little bit better against the same level of background noise but again the bar was pretty low for wireless headphones this is just generally good for calls for work for Stuff where you need a mic built into the headphones all right so my theory is Sony saw what Bose did with the 700 headphones with this new sliding design the magnet in the case and they said all right we can do that too and we'll do our own version of it and so they did an even bigger version of the same thing sliding design magnet in the case and everything and I'm slightly annoyed by the much bigger footprint here but I mean let's be real these are really good really comfortable premium noise cancelling headphones for 400 bucks with a terrible name as we'd expect from Sony but that's about what we'd expect it's good all right that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace"},

                'transcript': 'This is a definitive review and comparison by an audio engineer of the new Sony WH100XM6 wireless Bluetooth headphones with the prior generation Sony WH1000XM5. This review and comparison between the Sony WH100XM6 and the WH100XM5 will contain objective sound samples of music, microphones, A&C, transparency modes, gaming latency tests, and more. Chapters are enabled in this video. Since this is an immersive review, wear earbuds in both of your ears or a pair of headphones. If you\'re new here, welcome. My name is Brandon and I\'ve been a professional audio engineer for over 15 years, especially in the live concert and production field. By the end of this video, you can determine whether or not the Sony WH100XM6 is a right fit for you and whether or not you should buy it or upgrade from the XM5. If that\'s you, you\'ll find affiliate links to purchase in the description. It helps support the channel. Let\'s jump into the immersive experience with the first song sampled. You\'ll see the headphones you\'re listening to and the tests by looking at the label on the screen and the artists and song names I licensed for Music Bed at the bottom. This song is from my personal friend Hannah Parrot. It is mainly string based, so it\'ll give you a good sense of the mid-range warmth and how each headphone handles the high-end of the bow rubbing up against the strings. [Applause] [Music] One of the things that you first notice about the Sony WH100XM6 is the return of the foldable ear cup design, which I know many Sony fans will be thrilled to see. This makes it much easier to pack up independently or in the new smaller case with a magnetic latch. I freaking love magnets. Also, for those who have concerns about the durability of the latch and connection point on the XM6, you\'ll see that there\'s now a metal connection ring here that I\'m certain Sony added to help reinforce it and prevent any of those issues that prior models, including the XM5, have had. The Sony WH100XM6 has several other changes like a thicker headband for added comfort and an asymmetrical design, which makes it really easy to tell which side is the right side and which one is the left by feel alone. Because of these changes, the XM6 is far more comfortable than the XM5. It also has a stronger clamp force, so if you thought the XM 5 was too easy to slip off your head, well, this should help. And on both the XM6 and XM 5, I can wear glasses without interfering with the sound orc performance, but your mileage may vary. The XM6 ear depth is about 7/8 of an inch. an increase from the 3/4 of an inch on the XM5. An awesome detail is that the ear cupuffs are easily removable and replaceable on the XM6. I honestly can\'t tell if the XM5 can do this, but it surely does not come off easily if it does. It also has a larger, more obvious power button, 12 mics up from the eight on the XM5, which helps with A&C, transparency, and the microphone, which we\'ll test later on in this video. It also allows you to listen to music while charging. For that charging, the battery life is the same between each model with 30 hours of music playback with ANC on and 40 hours with off. 3 minutes of charging provides three hours of playback and 10 minutes for 5 hours. Both still have the swipe gesture surface on the right ear cup for volume, play, pause, track changes, etc. And the ability to activate the quick attention mode when you place your palm on it to go into a temporary transparency mode easily. They also have wear detection and the option to listen to wired high-res music over the headphone cable. What\'s fantastic for the XM6 is that you can now listen to music over the headphone cable while it\'s being charged, but there\'s still no option to listen to music via the USBC cable. The XM6\'s texture and feel is much better than on the XM5. The XM5 has a soft touch surface that feels great, but is quite prone to showing scuffs and marks on the black model. The XM6 has more of a matte texture instead and will look less worn over time. Available launch colors are black, blue, and this nice off-white color that I have here. Overall, I\'m a big fan of the design. It\'s not too far of a departure from the XM5, but it has many refinements learned from the XM5 and hopefully alleviates any of the issues found in that design. For this next song, listen to the low end, the reverb from the vocals, and the snare, and the sharpness of the high hat and the stereo spread from the Waw Wa sounds. And let us know in the comments what you [Music] notice. The [Music] heart you know, you know you\'re Feel it in the bloodream. [Music] [Music] The Sony WH100XM6 and XM5 continue to support Android Fair on compatible Android phones. The ability to connect to two devices simultaneously. Speak to chat capabilities which enables transparency mode briefly when you begin talking. adaptive sound control based upon scenes or situations. LDAC upscaling up to 96 kHz 24-bit audio and DE extreme on Android NAC and SBC codecs. With the XM6, you gain Bluetooth 5.3 up from 5.2, which is on the XM5, which means that the XM6 now supports LE audio or Bluetooth low energy audio and Oracast. Bluetooth 5.3 and 5.4 are rated for about 800 ft of distance. I can easily walk all around my two-story house without losing connection until the furthest end and through all these doors and walls. And that\'s only a brief cutout if once or twice when the Bluetooth connect quality is set to prioritize sound quality over stable connection, which would surely alleviate this if you switched. Both models support Sony\'s 360 reality audio, spatial sound, and headtracking, but the XM6 now has a feature that allows you to take any content and utilize spatial audio unmix to enjoy a more cinematic immersive experience. One thing that I love to see on the XM6 is the new 10b EQ option, which gives you more flexibility and control over the sound that you can dial in to your taste. The XM5 only had a five band EQ, so having twice as much is awesome. I do have my own custom EQ for the XM6 and the XM5 available for channel members, but we\'ll check out how it sounds later on in this video. The XM6 also has a new find your equalizer feature that can help you find a tuning that matches your taste based upon their guided process. It\'s a little bit easier than using the EQ. I think this is fine for something quite basic, but it\'s pretty limited and I really couldn\'t quite get the sound I wanted compared to using EQ. This next track is filled with a lot. Listen to the subfrequencies, the high-end from the snare and high hat type sounds and the mid-range from the syn [Music] Now for the fun part of the review, tests. Starting with gaming latency tests. This one is relatively straightforward. You\'ll see how many frames pass between the time that I tap the screen and when you hear the resulting sound effect in the Call of Duty game. Let\'s compare them. As you can see, both maintain the same delay of 13 frames. That\'s a bit confusing since the XM6 supports LE audio priority, which should lower latency and benefit gaming. But ultimately, I I wouldn\'t use it either for competitive gaming, which requires a faster response time. For this track, listen to how clear the bass guitar is, as well as the electric guitar and how bright the symbols are. [Music] You know you\'re doing something to me. What you trying to do? What you trying to do? Hey. Hey. Hey. [Music] Of the 12 mics on the Sony WH100XM6, six are beam forming mics to help pick up your voice for calls. This is two more than the XM5. So, the question is, do we notice a notable difference? Let\'s find out with some objective tests. Again, you\'ll see which environment and scenario are being tested by looking at the labels on the screen. Here\'s what a Zoom call would sound like if you\'re using the Sony WH100XM6 for the microphone. How do you think it sounds? Here\'s what the Sony WH100XM5 sound like if we were to use them for the microphone in a Zoom call. This is what it would sound like if you were to receive an HD phone call from someone who\'s wearing and using the Sony WHh100XM6 as the microphone. Here\'s what it would sound like if you were to receive an HD phone call from someone who\'s wearing and using the Sony WH100XM5 for the microphone. Here\'s what a phone call would sound like if you were wearing the Sony WH100XM6 and a simulated windy environment. And here\'s what the Sony WH100XM5s would sound like in a simulated windy environment. If you\'re on a HD phone call, the microphone would sound like What were your observations? Overall, they sounded close to each other in every scenario and situation, at least to me. Perhaps the XM6 performed slightly better in a windy environment, but there are enough variables that make it hard to find a clear winner. But let me know what you think in the comments. For this song, pay attention to the clarity of the attack on the acoustic guitar strings and how forward the mid-range is on the body of the guitar and vocals. When the nights get cold, sometimes when I look over, I see you by a fire with your hands out in the open. And I wonder if you\'re singing an autumn [Music] song. But if I\'m singing all alone, I must be singing on my own. With the Sony WH100XM6, Sony says it\'s the best noise cancelling headphone ever. Not just from Sony, but the whole industry, according to tests, at least. They say this results from the new processor, the four extra mics, and the new adaptive noise cancelling optimizer over the auto optimizer on the XM5. This adaptive noise cancelling optimizer supposedly performs even better across the whole frequency range of what we can hear, but especially in the mid-range where a lot of the body of sounds resides, but it\'s one thing to hear Sony\'s talking points. It\'s another to objectively test it and hear the samples for yourself. So, let\'s check them out. For a baseline test in terms of transparency mode, here is what the recording sounds like without any headphones on there or transparency mode. This is just what the mics sound like. Here\'s what the Sony WHh100XM6 sounds like in a simulated quiet room in transparency mode. Here is what the Sony WHh100XM5 sound like in transparency mode in a clean, quiet room. And here\'s what the microphones sound like on their own. Here\'s what the Sony WH100XM6 sound like inc mode in a quiet room. Here\'s what the Sony WH100XM5 sound like inc mode in a quiet room. Here\'s what the Sony WH100XM6 sound like in transparency mode in a simulated windy environment. Here is what the Sony WHH100XM5 sound like in transparency mode in a simulated windy environment. Here is what the Sony WH100XM6 sound like in A&C mode in a simulated windy environment. Here is the Sony WHh100XM5s inc mode in a simulated windy environment. Here is what the Sony WH100XM6 sound like in transparency mode in a simulated cafe environment. Here\'s what the Sony WH100XM5 sound like in transparency mode in a simulated cafe environment. Here\'s what the Sony WH100 XM6 sound like mode. simulated cafe environment. Here\'s what the Sony WH100 XM5 sounds like in a simulated cafe environment in EMC mode. What did you notice? What stood out to me is how naturally sounding the transparency mode is on the XM6. It has more high-end and body to the sound compared to the XM5, which sounds a bit dull and thin. ANC is certainly improved on the XM6 and lowers the overall sound across your hearing range, but a bit more on the body or mid-range of the sound is cut out, leaving mostly higher frequencies still lingering. This is in comparison to the XM 5, which leaks just enough audio to sound fuller and more distracting compared to the XM6. So, funny thing, on the first day of testing out the XM6, I made a meal while wearing them and then had my meal, only to realize once I took them off that I had left the exhaust fan above my suit on the whole time. That certainly made me go, "Wo, these things are pretty good." This track is a very mid-range, warm, and soulful track. Listen to her vocals, the electric guitar lines, and the keyboard. Call out your name. And together we rise above it all. You\'re my reason. You\'re my peace. The more I breathe in, the less I need. My heart is beating for your slow and sweet. I know you\'re the reason for my me and you\'re my reason and you\'re my peace. The more I breathe you, the less I need. My heart is beating for your slow and sweet. My heart is beating. I know you. You\'re the reason for my [Applause] [Music] Now, my favorite part of an audio review is the sound quality. First, some context. During my briefing with Sony, they said that the Sony WH1000 XM6 was tuned by Sony engineers and mastering engineers for various musical artists. It\'s hard to figure out how seriously to take this and how much they are involved in the tuning of the XM6. You know, is it just marketing or is it real? Still, it indicates that Sony\'s not leaning hard towards following objective frequency graphs or measurements to hit a specific target like a harmon curve. Instead, it\'s being tuned from the ear alone. The new drivers in the XM6 have a more rigid dome that Sony says results in richer details, clearer vocals, improved balance, and smoother and extended highfrequency reproduction. As you\'ve listened to the song samples throughout this video, have you heard anything that seems to align with these claims? Initially, when I first listened to the Sony WH100XM6, I thought is more of the same Sony sound with a darker, warmer sound with more muted high-end. I describe this as kind of being under the blanket. In many ways, this first impression still rings true, but it\'s more nuanced than that. Over the past few generations, Sony has been progressively moving more and more towards a more balanced sound with a clearer and more elevated high-end and less of that tubby, bloated low-end. The sound is becoming more mature sounding on the flagship WH1000 lineup with the new Alt line fulfilling the desires of those who want that bonkers low-end at the expense of clear high-end and balance. The more mature sound continues with the XM6. The subtle differences are more obvious when you listen to the XM6 and the XM 5 backto back. The XM6 has more high-end detail and clarity than the XM 5, a wider sound stage, and a sound that feels less constrained. I kind of describe the XM5 as like you\'re speaking into a cup a little bit. Listening to vocals on the XM5 feels like they\'re right in my face or in my nose. While the XM6, it sounds a bit more balanced, smooth, and clean to me. It\'s still very much a Sony sound, but better yet, not quite the sound I prefer. I have a fix for that. But first, let\'s listen to another song. Pay attention to the symbols, highend, the kick drums attack, and the bass guitar is warm. We\'re just hanging around with nothing to do. Summer loving, give me something. I\'m about to lose my mind. Cuz when I see you, I really think I need you every single summer time. and all the seasons in between singing. They can try and mess with me. But I can tell you when the feelings right cuz it feels just [Music] like with my experience as an audio engineer specifically mixing live bands. I love EQing things and making them sound better and more aligned with my preferences. So I created a custom EQ for the Sony WH100 XM6 that makes it way better with a more precise and detailed high-end and a punchier and cleaner low-end. The XM6 handles EQ very well. Let\'s listen to a song sample to hear what it sounds like. But this EQ is available for channel members who can become one by tapping the join button next to the subscribe button. Becoming a member gives you access to my custom EQs for the Sony WH100XM 6, the XM5, and many other headphones and earbuds along with wallpapers created from camera tests from various smartphone reviews and other exclusive content. This does help support this channel, cover some of the costs of the editors I work with, and covers the purchase of products to review. So, your support is always appreciated. Let\'s listen to that song sample and see how the custom EQ cleans things up and makes it more punchy in the kick drum and bass guitar. This song has a lot of great reverb. Listen to how forward the vocals sound and whether you can hear much of the percussive instruments in the background or if they sound buried. The mini range can bring out some of the instruments. The bass guitar is also a significant part of the song. I need a west coast sunset paradise. I need I need a place to feel. I need to get away. I need a west coise. I need to get away. [Applause] [Music] So, should you get the XM6 or upgrade? It\'s $450 USC or $600 Canadian. Before you spend that much money, you want to ensure it\'s the right fit for you. Here are some questions to help you determine if it\'s worth upgrading to or getting the Sony WH100XM6. If you want a foldable hinge design, the XM6 is worth considering. Have you found the XM5 to be uncomfortable around the headband or that it easily fell off? The XM6 would be a nice upgrade for you. If you are hoping for a dramatic difference in microphone quality, well, the XM6 is not going to give you that huge leap. If you want to listen to music using the headphone cable while the device is charging, the XM6 is perfect for you. If you want LE audio and orcast support, the XM6 is an excellent reason to consider upgrading. If you want the best A&C, definitely get the XM6. If you\'ve been satisfied with the XM5\'s ANC and transparency mode, it may be worth considering holding on to them longer and saving some money. The XM6 would be a good choice if you want a more natural sounding transparency mode. If you mostly like the Sony sound, but wish it were a touch clearer than the XM5 or prior models, the XM6 might give you some slight refinement. However, if you\'re more hands-on and like to tinker with EQs, the XM6\'s 10B EQ would make that easier. So, do you think the Sony WH100 XM6 is for you? Let me know what you think in the comments. And remember the affiliate link in the description. This song has a killer baseline. Pay attention to that. The synth and the vocal [Music] [Applause] reverb. We might not have forever. No time for taking chances for you and you. Where the lights go out, we can\'t keep on dancing. We are in the dark. In the dark for you, it will be you till the end of the world. Till the end of the world. Yeah. Cuz if the world is just So, which one is for me? While there are not many dramatic differences in quality between the XM 5 and XM 6, the sum of all the improvements truly make the XM6 a compelling option to get or upgrade to. It\'s a great set of refinements with the standout being how much better the ANC and transparency modes are. Plus, the move towards a more mature sound and the ease of EQ in getting the sound that I want make the Sony WH100XM6 even more compelling to me. The hardware refinement, sound, additional software capabilities like our cast make this even easier. So, I would easily pick the Sony WH100XM6. Here\'s another excellent song that covers a ton of the frequency range. Listen to how the high-end and mid-range change between headphones. [Music] Dangers in the city so [Music] they fall into the flames. Don\'t knock my reckless ways. We\'ll be unbreakable, unmistakable. Live in over time. The world is waking up and the move will taste the blood will be [Music] unbreakable. Although the $50 price increase for the Sony WH100 XM6 compared to the launch price of the XM5 is unfortunate. I can confidently say that this is a great upgrade and worth considering because of its sum of its parts and refinement. The XM6 seems like the most mature release from Sony in their entire history of their WH1000 line. But I\'d love to know if you think the same thing. What are your thoughts? Let me know in the comments. This song is an arena stomper that throws a wide spectrum of frequencies at you. Pay attention to how the high-end and mid-range change between headsets. On some headphones, the high-end can sound a bit shrill for the high [Applause] [Music] hat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. This review was made possible by Sony, which sent me a pair of the Sony WH100XM6 for review. I was not obligated to make a video on the Sony WH100XM6.

                'transcript': "according to sony the new wh-1000xm5 headphones are not a replacement for the xm4 they're an upgrade and the xm5 pricing reflects that but which one should you buy welcome back everyone i'm caleb dennison and while this whole idea that the xm5 are an upgrade over the xm4 that might just be a marketing move by sony the fact is that for the foreseeable future both models will exist right next to each other on store shelves both physically and virtually now sony has promised a number of upgrades for the xm5 and in my review of these headphones i think i made it pretty clear that sony delivered on those promises but what we haven't done yet is directly compare the two and answer the question of whether the xm5 are worth the added cost i mean the xm4 sat at the top of our best headphones list since the day they came out which means they are still stellar headphones but the xm5 did dethrone them so let's dig in and see if we can figure out which might be the best choice for you hey before i roll these headphones out i just wanted to ask you to do me a favor and support the channel clickity-click you know the drill it really means a lot to me and helps us grow and hey leave me a comment down below with any questions and i will do my best to help you out and if i can't our awesome community probably can okay thanks so much [Music] now let's quickly start with the unboxing experience xm4 come in pretty premium packaging which gives you the prided ownership vibe you're looking for when you spend a good chunk of change on a piece of tech but check out the difference with the xm5 there isn't an ounce of plastic involved here and when you peel off this outer cardboard wrap what you're left with is a very plain jane box that is clearly made of recycled material that is itself recyclable and in the end when all this is going in a bin anyway it makes sense to let the function outweigh the form you notice though that the box itself is bigger and well that's because the case is bigger too and this is where the most obvious differences between the two come into play the xm5 case is bigger and u-shaped the xm4 clearly more compact the reason the xm5 case is bigger is actually a big one they don't collapse down and maybe that right there is a deal breaker for you this means they'll take up more space in your pack whether you use the case or not but there's also less moving parts and this is a little thing but i was always frustrated by the learning curve involved in getting the xm3 and xm4 packed up looking inside the xm5 case i see something new and something missing this magnetic flap and compartment for the cables is new and way better than the little slot available in the xm4 case but missing is the airline adapter will it really be missed though something tells me most folks won't miss this relic and honestly if you're on a plane that still has this kind of headphone output well you have other things to worry about look i'm not being elitist i'm just saying that's an old plane one more quick thing and it is a complaint look i'm all for minimalism but i've said it before and i'll say it again sony this charging cable is too short this is not useful in 90 of use cases even with a portable charging battery i still want a longer cable why are you doing this to us anyway the xm5 have pretty strong bose 700 vibes going the headband and adjustment is similar the little accessory space with magnetic door even the shape of the case itself but considering most folks buy these kind of headphones for travel i think the xm4 are more travel friendly from a logistics point of view if compactness is a big deal to you the xm4 are the better choice okay moving on let's look at the headphones themselves you may not be able to collapse the xm5 in like you could with previous models but look at the more modern lines you get this is just a sleeker set of headphones and frankly the xm series was in need of a refresh am i right i mean the name is definitely in need of some changing but this is definitely a fresher look and they don't just look different they feel different too most noticeable is the weight you can feel the difference just holding the headphones in each of your hands and the xm5 are definitely lighter and that translates into more comfort on your head you feel the difference right away and you'll feel the difference after hours of wearing at a time then there's the faux leather material it's just softer and more breathable and all of this makes them easier to wear for a long time so if you're someone who takes long flights or wears your headphones all day at work you'll definitely appreciate the lighter xm5 i mean for some folks that right there is enough of a reason to pay the premium for the xm5 now i'm about to get to performance but before i do we have to talk about the battery the xm5 will still give you about 30 hours of performance listening to music with anc on or about 20 hours of talk time and that's the same as the xm4 however the quick charge capability is way more useful you'll get three hours of performance from just three minutes of charging but there is a catch to get that kind of quick charge you'll need a usb pd or usb power delivery capable charging block otherwise the quick charge is similar to the xm4 which will do about five hours of performance off 10 minutes of charging so for most folks i think the battery isn't really a huge differentiator between the two now as promised let's talk performance and i'm gonna break this down into three sections noise cancelling call quality and audio performance starting with the noise canceling the xm5 are superior they cut out more of the high mids and treble frequencies than the xm4 in fact i think the xm5 have the best noise cancelling you can get from any headphone on the market period and that's thanks to the addition of a second audio processor and the addition of more microphones the xm5 have double the onboard mics as the xm4 there's now four per ear cup and they are all put to excellent use now i think the xm4 are more than sufficient for most folks honestly with both of these headphones when you start playing movies or music that's basically all you're going to hear but if you're just looking for quiet the xm5 will cut out more of the noise around you including the cutting treble in a person's voice or the high end wish of wind rushing by i should also note that the xm5 automatically optimized the noise cancelling based on environmental measurements on the xm4 you could do that but you had to use an app with the xm5 it just happens as for call quality no question the xm5 are better if you spend a lot of time on the phone or zoom calls and you can't always get to a quiet space trust me when i say the xm5 will basically erase any background noise going on barking dogs jackhammer the bustle of baristas in a coffee shop no problem the xm5 will make you sound like you're all alone in a room by yourself even if you're in the middle of a construction zone yes they really are that good as for the voice quality itself well you're not gonna record a podcast with these they're just not that good but for phone calls and video meetings yeah they do the trick nicely i think only the airpods max really have better voice quality finally let's talk about audio quality here i'm willing to say that i like the xm5 a bit better but the difference is pretty nuanced the most obvious difference is in the low end i feel like the xm5 have more refined bass which is not a way of saying they have significantly less bass it is true that the xm5 are not quite as base forward as the xm4 and they don't smack you with punch quite as hard though the punch is certainly not gone i'll put it this way if you are in the camp of the bigger the base the better i think you'll prefer the xm4 if you like a little more balance but still plenty of bass the xm5 are a bit more refined in the low end the sound stage instrumental separation overall timbre they're so close that i don't think any of the other sound quality elements are on their own a reason to switch or upgrade and hey if you want more bass out of the xm5 there's sony's headphone app and it's eq with built-in presets so bringing it all together all that is to say that if you want the best possible noise cancelling the best call quality and the most comfortable fully featured cans on the market then yeah the xm5 are the ticket the comfort alone makes them worth the extra few bucks for most folks the call quality makes them worth the premium to some folks who use them a lot for calls and the better noise cancelling again i think will appeal to certain people who need a certain level of quiet in their life but bundle those three together and they are absolutely worth the extra money if you need the absolute best but if your needs are not that specific or that demanding even if you just want the more compact form factor or the better rotation on the ear cups the xm4 are the better deal overall like if the xm5 didn't exist i wouldn't let you pry the xm4 from my cold dead hands they are still one of the best sets of full featured cans you can buy maybe even second best by some measurements so it's not like you're settling going with the xm4 not by a long stretch it's just that the xm5 are next level insanely good thanks as always for watching everybody if you like this video do me a favor and hit that like button maybe consider subscribing and here's

                'transcript': "okay so these are the new sony wh-1000xm5 headphones and this is a very easy review for me to do because these have great noise cancellation great audio quality and a great comfortable feel and this has been the case ever since like the xm2s that came out years ago so i didn't want to just like focus on that but i did want to focus on how these compare to the previous xm4s because i think a lot of people are going to be trying to make a decision between these two whether you already own the xm4s or you're looking at trying to buy one or the other and that's because sony will still be selling these xm4s on their website so you can still get these for 350 where the xm5s will be costing you 400. and so with that being said let's go ahead and compare these two so the first thing you're going to notice is the difference in design these x and fives are meant to be more premium especially with that higher price and you do get that with this synthetic leather that's like on the entire headband here at the top and also with the ear cups as well so when you pick up these it feels like you're mostly going to be touching leather which adds to that premium feel and then also you will find that when you do put these on your head they actually do feel more comfortable than the xm4s now to be honest with you the xm4s have been very comfortable for me i've worn them on flights that lasted like seven eight nine hours so i never found them to be uncomfortable but just comparing them to the x and fives um the headband on the x5 does feel a little bit lighter on my head and also the suction that i get from the ear cups as far as the seal they make around my ears they feel more or just as secure as the xm4s but they don't feel as like heavy and again the xm4s are fine just i'm just comparing the two i'm going to try to let you know now one other thing that you will notice is that both of the ear cups on these headphones do swivel so they can kind of form to your head if you have an oddly shaped head like i do that's always going to be welcome so you still get that but the one thing missing from the xm5s that's a big deal for me because i travel a lot with these is the ability to be able to fold up like you can with these xm4s just like this on the x and fives you can't do that there's no folding or anything like that so the best case scenario is for you to have them flat like this so this right here makes a big difference for me because i do a lot of one bag travel where i carry my backpack and all of my you know tech all of my clothes everything is in that one bag so being able to have this to be able to be folded up like this and fit in something like a camera cube is awesome for me um and because these extra flies can't i feel a little bit you know bad if i do put them in my bag without some type of protection and especially with them having this design it just feels like they're more prone to be broken in the back without protection now sony does include a case with these xm5s which is actually a really nice case and one thing you will notice with the case is that it starts out thick in the back and then ends up a little bit slimmer in the front and then also too when you put the headphones inside of this they will be laying flat and you also do have a little kind of pouch right here magnetic pouch that opens up where you can put some cables and some other things in there and then flop it down it's going to be secure now the xm4s do also come with a case and the case is going to be even more smaller obviously because it's you have that design to be able to allow you to fold it up like that so if you do want to carry both of these with protection the xm4 is going to be better for traveling because of this compact nature and also the smaller case now to be fair most of the headphones in this price bracket for the xm5s don't fold up either so they're not really doing anything out of the ordinary but it is kind of out of the ordinary with the wh series so that's the first thing that really jumped out to me is the fact that they can't fold up anymore but luckily i do have both but that might be a deciding factor for you now both of these headphones come in the same two colors so you have the black that i'm showing you today and also that sony tan color that they've been using for a long time now the tan is cool but i would like to see more color options especially like a gray or white or something so i think sony has a lot of room to play around with with the colors for these and so what else what else oh the xm5s do not have nfc so you have that on the xm4 so on the right ear cup you can bring your phone over and tap it and then you'll get a notification asking if you want to pair them with your smartphone and that happens really fast where on the xm5 you just have to go through the app or through the bluetooth settings oh and when it comes to adjusting the headphones for your head you will find a different mechanism so with the xm4s this is how it looks and sounds okay so it has like that zip tie type of sound but with the xm5s this is what you see and what you hear okay so you can hear that it is acquired to operation and it is just a more premium type of feel when you are adjusting that i'm gonna be using that premium word a lot in this review now on the right ear cups for these headphones you will find the usb-c port that you will be using for charging and speaking of charging and battery life these both still have a 30 hour battery life so nothing is different with that but you will find a difference in the fast charging times so with the xm5s when you do plug them in in just three minutes you can get three hours of playback but with the xm4s in 10 minutes you will get just five hours of playback so if you adjust for the amount of time between those you will find that you can get a quicker charge with more time back with the xm5 so i don't really use this a lot i'm not really in that type of time crunch but if you do get on the plane and you forgot to charge them um if you do have an outlet you can plug them in and just really be able to go back to being wireless in a faster amount of time with the xm5s and then on the right ear cups for both of these headphones you will find a 3.5 millimeter headphone port there so you can still go wired and then also you will find two buttons one for the power and bluetooth pairing and then the other one is going to be able to adjust the noise cancellation and the ambient sound mode so on the xm4s you will see that they call it the custom button but on the xm5s they have it dedicated to be called noise canceling or ambient mode and the reason it's called the custom button on the xm4 is that with that button you can control the noise cancellation mode ambient sound mode and also activating the voice assistant for your phone but on the xm5s it only controls noise cancellation and ambient sound mode in order to use the voice assistant on the xm5s you have to use the touch controls on the right ear cup to be able to activate that so if you are the person who doesn't like to actually use the touch controls on the headphones and you turn them off you also won't be able to use a voice assistant and speaking of noise cancellation let's go ahead and talk about that so on the xm5 sony has doubled the hardware components that go into handling noise cancellation so you have two processors compared to the one and the x and fours and also you have a total of eight microphones compared to the four microphones so basically each ear cup has four microphones in them on the xm4s you only have two in each of those ear cups and with the extra processing power in the xm5s you now have this new auto noise cancellation optimizer feature which allows the headphones to be able to automatically detect if you're in a car or if you're walking or if you're on a plane and adjust the performance of the noise cancellation to those specific environments now with the x-men force you can still do this but you have to go into the app and do it manually to be able to tell the headphones that you're on a plane or something so i like that all of that is happening automatically on these xm5s and as far as like the general performance look these are embargo so i couldn't just wear them out in public all the time but i did sneak these on a plane and i had my hoodie over my head and i was able to listen to them for a little while and the noise cancellation is really rock solid but when i do compare the noise cancellation to the xm4s i did a test around here where i had some audio in the corner and i kept switching the headphones back and forth and i didn't really hear that drastic of a difference but i'm also not an audiophile either so maybe my ears aren't tuned for that but you know sony says that this will be able to handle the frequencies a lot better when it comes to noise cancellation so i'm just taking their word on it but i i think as far as the real world uses don't expect two times the performance just because you have two times the processing power and two times the microphones but basically that's going to be translating to the noise canceling optimization that it has to automatically adjust to depending on the the environment that you're in so that's where all of that power for me is mostly going to but the noise cancellation with either one of these is still going to be one of the best in the industry but when it comes to ambient sound mode i did hear a noticeable difference with these xm5s versus the xm4s so basically ambient sound mode is going to be using the microphones to pump in some audio so you can hear your surrounding environment and basically i one of the things i really noticed was that i didn't really hear the hum of my ac as much with these xm5s as i did with the xm4s which it can kind of sound a little bit annoying so they definitely cleaned that up with the ambient sound mode oh and something else that's coming over from the xm4s that's found his way to the xm5s is the ability to temporarily activate the ambient sound mode so maybe you're using noise cancellation but you quickly want to hear someone talking to you you can press your hand on the right ear cup and then it will automatically activate the ambient sound mode so you can have a natural conversation and then when you release your hand noise cancellation will turn back on and also your audio will start playing and something else both of these headphones have is the speak to chat function or is it speak to talk i can't remember but anyway basically if you do enable it when you start talking and you're wearing these headphones it will automatically notice that and then activate the ambient sound mode so you can continue your conversation and then when you stop talking it will go ahead and turn the noise cancellation back on so again that's a feature that you have to enable yourself but it's pretty cool and then on the right ear cups of both of these headphones you have the ability to swipe up and down to adjust the volume or you can swipe left and right to be able to go between the different songs that you're listening to so you have these touch controls that will allow you to control your audio playback and also if you're answering phone calls and stuff like that now speaking of phone calls let's talk about that difference so out of the eight microphones on the xm5s four of them are going to be beamforming where on the xm4s you don't have any beamforming microphones you still have microphones to hold a phone call but it's not going to be as good as the xm5s because being forming means that it's going to be able to focus on your voice and try to block out all of the background noise and stuff to make your calls crystal clear so let's go ahead and listen to the difference between these two when it comes to call quality okay so this first test is using the xm4s i am indoors and this is how it sounds using the built-in microphones i have a little bit of background noise with the ac going and the air coming out of the vents but for right now i'm about to just be quiet for five seconds so you can see how it sounds when i'm not speaking all right now i'm about to switch over to the xm5s and now we're on the xm5 so this is how it sounds with the new hotness going on so um the audio quality should be better but you be the judge let me know down in the comments which one you think sounds better but right now i am going to be quiet for another five seconds so you can see how it sounds when i'm not speaking and now i'm about to quickly switch back over to the xm4s okay so we're back over to the xm4s and i'm about to switch it right back over to the xm5 and now we're back on the xm5 so again let me know which one sounds better down in the comments okay so now let's talk about audio quality because these are headphones by the way but yeah so with the xm5s you have this new carbon fiber 30 millimeter drivers inside of these um so that's going to be hopefully giving you some better audio quality but look i'm not an audiophile so you're not going to get a very technical explanation from me with this but what i will say is that when i was listening to multiple genres of music i really noticed the low end and the bass um that it that it was tighter on these xm5s especially when i listened to the dunkirk soundtrack by my man hans zimmer because that music was really based off of tension so the drums or whatever that was creating that low end was very very um you know prevalent in that music and i found that i enjoyed it a lot better on these xm5s versus on the x and fours doesn't mean that it sounds muddy or something on the xm4s it's just that it sounded better on the xm5s but when it came to like the highs and the mids and all that other stuff i didn't really hear like a significant difference between these two headphones um so generally i will say that if you're like me just someone who wants the music to sound good no matter if i'm listening to it in apple music or spotify and maybe you're not going to take advantage of the ldac or the dse extreme support that you have in these headphones if you're like me you just want something that sounds great these xm5s are going to be better but it's not that type of gap between these and the xm4 is where i think it's going to be a big deciding factor for people they both sound great the x15 sound better but again it's not going to be something very drastic all right so what else about these xm5s so they do come in plastic free packaging so it's going to be very responsible packaging that's going to be easily recyclable for you and also these do have a multi-point connection so you can have these paired with two devices at the same time and that's going to be better than what you can do with the xm4s because you can use the sony headphones app to be able to designate which one of those devices or the two devices that you want to pair with and then also when you are switching between those two devices it's a more seamless connection as you're doing that where you don't have to do anything you can just start playing something on that other device and it'll go ahead and automatically switch over to the audio coming from that one so look at the end of the day you have two really good headphones to choose from and hopefully this review gave you a good idea about which one might be the best for you if you're looking for the best portable better traveling headphones the xm4s are definitely that but if you want that premium experience when it comes to better audio better noise cancellation um in theory then also to better ambient sound mode a better premium design as far as how it feels when you touch it and also when you do put it on your head and these refinement to features like the multi-point connection and those type of things are better with these xm5s these are a better pair of headphones but there are some things that might make you choose one over the other and i just really like the fact that sony is keeping both of these so you have an option and as consumers i always say the more options we have the better and especially when that happens within the same company so the choice is yours and let me know down in the comments which one of these would you choose for yourself and like always thanks for watching this video hit that subscribe and notification button like this video if you did like it and i will catch you later peace"},

                'transcript': "Sony WH100XM6 review. The return of a legend. I've tested a lot of overear headphones in my life. Beat Studio Pros, Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra, even the Apple AirPods Max, but honestly, none of them match the perfect balance that the Sony WH100XM4s delivered. Lightweight, comfortable, incredible sound, and most importantly, foldable. So, when Sony released the XM5s in 2022, I was excited until I realized they didn't fold. That was a huge letd down for me. I skipped them entirely and waited. Now, Sony is back with the WH100XM 6s, and I'm glad to say they brought back everything I loved about the XM4s and made it better. The XM6 comes in a minimal premium box. Clean presentation as always. Inside you'll find a more compact carrying case thanks to the return of the foldable design. You also get a USBC charging cable, a 3.5 millimeter audio cable, and an airplane adapter. No clutter, just the essentials. Sony really listened this time. The XM6's fold again like the XM4s, making them much more travel friendly. They feel lighter on the head with a redesigned asymmetrical headband for better weight distribution. At just 8.9 O, they're super easy to wear for long periods. The platinum silver color, it pops. Stylish, modern, not just another boring pair of black headphones. But let's keep it real. The finish scratches easily. Just pulling it out of a bag can leave marks. And the ear cups, they stain fast, especially after gym sessions. You can clean them, but they're not stainproof. Something to keep in mind. Now, this is where the XM6 shines. Seamless multi-point connection. Switch between phone and laptop instantly. Improved touch controls. Still hit or miss, but the buttons are more intuitive now. You can mute your mic during calls by double pressing the noise cancelling button. The Sony app has improved with EQ presets, a personalized sound test, and Oracast support. Battery life. You're getting up to 30 hours with ANC on, 40 hours with it off. And yes, you can charge and listen at the same time. Now, the XM6s sound incredible. New drivers deliver richer detail, smoother highs, and better balance across all genres. From bass heavy tracks to podcasts and classical music, the sound feels clear and immersive. And if you love binaural beats or spatial audio, these are made for that. Let's talk A&C. Sony upgraded to the new QN3 processor with 12 microphones and advanced AI noise filtering. It blocks out almost everything, trains, coffee shops, even airplane noise. I've tested them on flights, in loud apartments, and on busy streets. They've delivered peace and quiet every time. Should you upgrade? If you're using the XM4s and they still work, you're good. But if you need a fresh upgrade, this is worth it."},

                'transcript': "let's compare the Sony xm5 to the Bose quiet Comfort Ultra from a design and looks point of view the QC Ultras are visibly built stronger but the XM 5S appear much nicer when wearing with a sleek and more minimal design I have to give it to the QC Ultras when it comes to sound quality they both are really so good I'm just a sucker for that kick and bit portability again goes to the QC Ultras you're able to fold them unlike the XM FS which means you have a more Compact and smaller carrying K noise cancellation is a clear tie and the XM 5S have a slightly longer lasting battery light but with the Sony's retail selling for $399 and the QC Ultras at $429 you won't be disappointed with either one do not buy them at retail as either one of these always seems to have some sort of crazy deal on Amazon so keep your eyes out for that and if you enjoyed this type of content like and follow for more"},

                'transcript': "if you're on the fence between the Sony XM 4S and XM 5S here's a breakdown between the two to help you make the right decision for pricing the XM 4S are $248 and the XM FS are $328 both have a plastic design making them lightweight but the XM FS are noticeably Slimmer which also means you can't fold them unlike the xm4 Comfort isn't a problem on either one of them as they're extremely comfortable but from extensive side-by-side testing and personal use I prefer the XM 5s for longer periods of time battery noise cancellation and sound quality are very similar if not the same either way though you can't go wrong and you'll be happy with both but let me know down below which one you would take"}]
